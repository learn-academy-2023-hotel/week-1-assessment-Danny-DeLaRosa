# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: 

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is like the cloud for software developers. they use git to upload their code and share it with others. git hub is a platform where the cloud lives. basically somewhere to send and recieve code to and from from developers.

Researched answer: I was kind of on the right track. git is systems that helps developers track their work. the difference is that you can use git without git hub because you dont need the website to track your work but you cant use github without git because git is the whole premise of the platform.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An arrays index is the placement of a value, basically where that value lies in an array. the value is how much that placement holds or what it holds (Number, string)

Researched answer: I was on the right track with index. index is a number that tells you the position of an element in an array, or the placement, starting from zero. I was also in the ballpark with value. Value is the data stored at the index, where that value is. the value of an index can be a number, string or even another array.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: arrays are a set of values in brackets that have been grouped together in a variable ie. var exampleArray = [firstvalue, secondvalue, "thirdvalue", [fourthvalue, fifthvalue]]. strings are any words or numbers contained in "quotes" the can be 'single' or "double" quotes. the similarity is that that both arrays and strings can be held in a variable. you can use q string inside of an array like i did in the example but you cant add brackets in quotes and call it an array, "[this]" ---> will output ---> this.

Researched answer: Strings and arrays are both collections but, strings are used to output "text" ---> text, and arrays are used to for structuring different data types like ["strings", Numbers, [another, 'array']]

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: npot really sure how to put this in y own words but object-oriented programming or OOP is a programming paradigm that was made to handle complexyties of large software systems. sounds like its a way to sectio the work in a program so that when programmers are manipulating the data, the whole program is not affected.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: higher-order functions are built in methods in js that were made to be used on arrays, these methods are useful for iterations.

2. Jest: jest is a testing framework for JS. jest is made up of many dependencies, or code segments that activate testing. yarn was made by facebook to manage the complexity of the dependencies. 

3. Objects: objects are one of the javascript primitive data types. objects have a collection of key:value pairs. objects are stroed in {curly braces}
